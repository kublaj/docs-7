# Browser support

Simpla supports all modern browsers:

| Browser           | Supported Version   |  
| :---------------- | :------------------ |  
| Google Chrome     | Current             |  
| Internet Explorer | 10+                 |  
| Microsoft Edge    | Current             |  
| Firefox           | Current             |  
| Safari            | 7+                  |  
| Opera             | Current             |  
| Safari Mobile     | Current             |  
| Chrome Mobile     | Current             |  

Simpla relies on an emerging family of specifications called [Web Components](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebComponents/). Support for Web Components is being actively developed by all major vendors - Google Chrome currently has full support, other browsers have partial support and require polyfills. 

In practice this means Simpla enjoys native-level performance in Chrome, and performance similar to other leading Javascript libraries in other browsers.
